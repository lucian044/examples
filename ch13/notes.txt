Object Oriented Programming - centered on creating objects

Object - contains both data (attributes) and functions (procedures) to handle that data
  it does this through the use of encapsulation

Encapsulation - combining data and code into a single object

Data Hiding - allows an object to prevent access to its members

Class - code that specifies the attributes and functions that an object may have
  - the ONLY difference between a struct and a class is the default access specification

Access Specification - determine how class (or struct) members may be accessed
  - public: can be accessed outside of the class member functions
  - private: - can only be accessed by class members
  - By default, all class members are private
  - By default, all struct members are public

Member Functions - functions declared within the class or struct
- has access to all of the objects members
- use const AFTER the declaration specifies the function will not the change the data in the calling object
  - void this() const;

Accessors and Mutators - used to retrieve and set private members
  -Accessors retrieve member data, usually used with const
  -Mutators set the member data
